            {/* Once both population and output begin to grow steadily, land tends to become increasingly scarce relative to other goods. The law of supply and demand then implies that the price of land will rise continuously, as will the rents paid to landlords. The landlords will therefore claim a growing share of national income, as the share
            available to the rest of the population decreases, thus upsetting the social equilibrium. ... The “scarcity principle” on which he relied meant that certain prices might rise to very high levels over many decades.
            landlords and oil well owners might well accumulate claims on the rest of the population so extensive that they could easily come to own everything that can be owned, including rural real estate and bicycles, once and for all.3 As always, the worst is never certain to arrive. It is much too soon to warn readers that by 2050 they may be paying rent to the emir of Qatar.
            In a lot of ways, Buffett's entire game plan is to slowly induce a Ricardian disaster:  own assets that enables price increases that are in excess of the growth rate of human productivity, which then
            in turn enables Buffett to acquire a greater and greater share of the total pie.

This is the basis of Marx’s prediction of an apocalyptic end to capitalism: either the rate of return on capital would steadily diminish (thereby killing the engine of accumulation and leading to violent conflict among capitalists), or capital’s share of national income would increase indefinitely (which sooner or later would unite the workers in revolt). In either case, no stable socioeconomic or political equilibrium was possible.

            Thomas Piketty's landmark book, <u>Capital</u> does an impressive amount of research with old French ledgers to make several very interesting arguments:
            a). Capital returns tend exceed growth of output
            b).

            an exceptional working paper on eight centuries of global real and nominal interest rates, from 1311 to 2018.

            The upshot?  That capital returns over very long periods of time are in "suprasecular decline" and that the fall in real and nominal interest rates over the last forty years are merely a reversion to long-term historical trends.<br/>

            What will the world look like when interest rates are near-zero?  Here are some ideas:<br/>
            <br/>1). Outsized wealth creation will no longer be realized by professional "asset compounders" like Warren Buffett.  Instead, we'll produce "asset gatherers" that invest in direct capital projects -- people who raise a lot of money to do something low-return and (legally) skim a bit off the top, because there's going to be simply so much more money floatin around.  Insofar as this is already painfully true of capitalism by the early 2000s, it will be even more the dominant reality for our grandchildren's grandchildren:
            it's almost impossible now to become wealthy by means of simply asset allocation alone.  Information is too widely distributed, and real asset returns over time are declining.  Someone like Warren Buffett was truly born in the right decade:  a time when, as he came of age, interest rates were unusually high (i.e., assets were unusually cheap) and began a long decline, driving outsized returns for "professional capitalists" and especially for value investors that (correctly) assigned a very high cost of capital to earnings.
            As real cost of capital returns have declined, low-multiple-investors (aka "value investors") have floundered because they fail to a). correctly capitalize the costs of software development as an asset, not an expense, b). overvalue near-term earnings because of their overly high cost-of-capital requirements.
            The flip, sadly, is that people like WeWork founder Adam Neumann become the dominant model of outsized wealth creation.
            <br/><br/>2). Monopolies will be more valuable than ever. As required returns lower, capital will flow toward non-monopolistic, competitive industries and reduce returns in those industries even further than where they are now. 
            What really matters isn't how much money a company is making per se, but the certainty that they will in fact earn those returns.  This certainty in maintaining pricing, margins, and market share enables investors to capitalize businesses at very high multiples because there's "nothing else left to invest in".
            <br/><br/>3). Commodity-capital industries become particularly bad industries over time.  Finance (main street banking, investment management, insurance) becomes even more commoditized than it already is.  Real estate cap rates should continue to decline and so should their associated capitalization requirements and costs of capital:  one day we'll commonly start to get 100% debt financed apartment complexes that only cost 3% to service, with the equity holder perhaps being paid 3.5% returns from renters. As holders of AMC Theaters bonds know, a 100% loan-to-value is a lot better than a 400% loan-to-value (okay, okay, low blow).
            <br /><br />4). Long-term unemployment rates will trend down (if everything else stays the same), while wealth blowback on the "1%" will likely expand to become wealth blowback on the "5%" or "10%".  I think the term <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional-managerial_class">PMC</Link> will almost certainly make a huge comeback among Gen Z.
            These twin factors occur together because while the number of industries that produce "outsized" returns will decrease (thereby shrinking the "equestrian class" of comfortable professionals), lower costs of capital would enable many more available "shitty" jobs (until robots and software take those too).
            <br/><br/>What happens when rates become negative?
