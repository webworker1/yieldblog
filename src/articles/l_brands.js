            <br/>Joel Tillinghast, a once-legendary portfolio fund manager at Fidelity, sometimes describes retail apparel investing as "momentum-based". After all, when it works, you look like a genius: people throw $20 bills at you in exchange for flimsy cotton shifts that cost $3.50 to manufacture and $5 to market.
            Every appareler is convinced they have the Midas touch, and <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_21">when it stops working</Link>, the public reacts to the your brand as if they'd awakened in some haze: "Why did we buy this stuff to begin with?" consumers wonder.
            "Why did we give this thing such a high multiple?" investors wonder.  Somehow, we never learn the lesson with apparel, and so the cycle continues. <br/>
            <br/>There's a subtle distinction I'd like to make, though. While "momentum" is a good first-order approximation, it doesn't really describe what's actually going on: a realization gradient.  Consumers over time realize the social capital that's being conveyed through apparel, and buy it because they come to an understanding.  The realization gradient works both ways: some consumers are less quick to realize the death of a brand, but they eventually catch on and stop buying as well.  The belief that apparel is a random walk down human preferences isn't accurate: rather, the social-capital zeitgeist shifts over time, and brands that are well-positioned to trade on that social capital do well.
            <br/><br/>Victoria's Secret is entering the negative realization death spiral.  The clothing is now perceived as both uncomfortable and promoting unhealthy expectations, and Les Wexner's <Link href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/10/20689134/jeffrey-epstein-les-wexner-l-brands-victoria-secret-limited">Epstein connection</Link> is certainly not helping.  The optics are horrendous.  What was once sexy is now complicit.  Worse, there are far, far too many competent competitors.  Let's review.
            <br/><br/>Gap Body has been exceptionally successful at targeting lingerie "basics".

            <br/><br/>Journelle and Nordstrom round out the midtier:

            <br/><br/>Agent Provocateur and La Perla round out the high end.

            Don't even get me started on the infinity of online competitors -- Adore Me, Panache, Hanky Panky, Heidi Klum Intimates, Mapale, Yummie, Addiction Nouvelle, Parfait, Le Mystere, Montelle Intimates, Giapenta, and Cosabella turn up with a few seconds of searching.  Victoria's Secret is deader-than-dead, and worse yet, has massive operating leases that will accelerate its demise.
            To be honest, I've never understood how lingerie at Victoria's Secret became such a dominant in-store purchasing phenomenon to begin with:  the shopping experience for men is at best awkward, and for women the brand is currently perceived as regressive, uncomfortable, and sexist.  
            I'd also argue that the competition is broader than we realize: various athleisure brands fulfill a similar body-positivity drive while mitigating any feelings of being <Link href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2018/11/25/thirdlove-tells-john-mehas-how-to-fix-victorias-secret-in-full-page-new-york-times-ad/#292449f72285">complicit</Link>.
            Limited Brands will of course cut non-performing VS stores, but the question is how fast?
            <br/><br/>There's an inherent tension between bondholders and equity holders here:  Les Wexner owns 17% of the outstanding equity, his wife owns another 5%, and will issue dividends until it becomes <Link href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraudulentconveyance.asp">fraudulent conveyance</Link> to continue to do so.  The fact that any dividends are being issued while a). the company needs to cut leases b). the company holds >$5bn in debt yielding 6%+ and c). sales are imploding demonstrates either incompetent corporate finance or denial on the part of Les Wexner.
            If US creditor protection were stronger, bondholders might be able to fire off warning letters now asking Limited Brands leadership to start cutting leases, paying down debt, and halting dividend issuance.  As it stands now, the only thing bondholders can do is sit back and record grievances until Chapter 11 gets filed.
            <br/><br/>I see only one way Limited Brands can pull itself out of this mess: Grow Bath & Body Works fast enough to offset Victoria's Secret losses.  While this might seem impossible, I estimate that by FY2021 Bath and Body Works could be larger than the VS brand.
