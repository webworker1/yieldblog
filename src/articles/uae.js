I first encountered Gulf-level wealth in while on vacation in Sri Lanka. In my room was a copy of Friday Magazine, a sort of Reader's Digest meets Travel and Leisure for the United Arab Emirates. With <a target="_blank" href="https://fridaymagazine.ae/travel"> articles </a> like "The Hague: power and the artistic glory", "Pedalling on the shores of the Baltic", and "Stalking lions aboard the Mardaraka Express", Friday Magazine featured a travel section that would make Conde Nast's Travel and Leisure look like a petite bourgeois bridge & tunnel rag.
                    It's no wonder: the UAE boasts a median "national" (non-foreigner) income of nearly $120,000 USD a year and <b> no income tax </b>.
