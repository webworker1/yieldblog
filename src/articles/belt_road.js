                    <h2> Ulterior Motives to Belt and Road </h2>

                    Imagine you are a responsible, career-minded 30-something Chinese millenial.  You earn 180,000 reminbi per year, which is nothing to 
                    Imagine you're a technocrat at the People's Bank of China.  You're just trying to do your job, which is to maintain China's foreign exchange reserves. 
                    
                    A lot of people look at the Chinese housing market and believe that world-class unaffordability equates to a bigger, faster crash.
                    This could not be farther from the truth. With a $50,000 USD annual foreign exchange quota, Chinese investors do not have better alternatives than a very inflated housing market.
                    While governmentally-reported inflation hovers between 3-4%, overall credit grows substantially faster than nominal GDP

                    Corporations have poor internal controls, are full of self-dealing and strange ownership structures, and given the performance of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, have generally have not produced any shareholder value in the past decade.

                    A different, perhaps heterodox way of thinking about this is to think of currency as tickets issued by an entity with the power of taxation and violence.  The inherent value of a dollar or a reminbi is not 
                    "faith" or "mutual agreement", but the fact that it literally represents the alleviation of a taxable unit.  "You will pay us 30% of your salary in the currency that we issue".  In this sense, we are all in fact part-time government employees:

                    <QuoteStub quotedText=" Total credit as of May 2017 was equivalent to 328% of 2016 nominal GDP, a 28% increase as a share of GDP compared with the end of 2015." />

                    <QuoteStub quotedText=" If interest servicing exceeds incremental
                        increase in nominal GDP, the debtor would need to pursue one of two courses of
                        action to avoid a crisis. First, creditors can extend even more credit to the debtors so that interest payments are serviced with new credit. This mechanism renders
                        China more of a Ponzi unit, which requires new credit to service interest payments.
                        Alternatively, a rising share of income for households, firms, or government will go
                        toward servicing interest. While the first dynamic would cause the acceleration of
                        debt accumulation, the second dynamic is tantamount to a massive tax which will
                        slow growth for an extended period." />                                

                    <QuoteStub quotedText="Even at 50 trillion RMB, however, shadow credit still pales in comparison to assets held by the formal banking
                    system, which had 240 trillion RMB in assets at the end of June 2017." />

                    <QuoteStub quotedText="In the classic set up of shadow financing, a bank transfers an on-balance
                        sheet loan to an off-balance sheet vehicle such as a wealth management product
                        (WMP), trust product, or an asset management plan (AMP). The funding for that
                        “purchase” comes from the private banking division of the bank, which channels
                        clients’ deposits into a shadow banking product" />
                    <QuoteStub quotedText="In other words, if households and firms were to move just 10% of money supply overseas, China’s FX
                        reserves would basically be depleted. The need for China to increase its money
                        supply directly links its domestic credit bubble to a potential crisis triggered by
                        capital flight. The legal channel for moving money out of China by and large is composed of
                        two steps. First, banks have to convert RMB into US dollars for customers. Second, customers have to get their banks to wire the converted US dollars to Hong
                        Kong or other offshore locations. Figure 7 shows the ebbs and flows of banks’ net
                        conversion (negative denotes conversion into dollar) and banks’ net remittance
                        (negative denotes moving funds out of China) on behalf of customers, as well
                        as monthly changes in the FX reserves, including reserves net of the valuation
                        effect.10 As one can see, these numbers largely correlate with each other. That is,
                        when bank customers convert RMB savings into dollars, banks have to buy more
                        dollars from SAFE to satisfy dollar demand, thus depleting the FX reserves" />

                <QuoteStub quotedText="Faced with increasingly draconian capital controls, exporters who earned
                        USD increasingly opted to receive payment abroad (i.e. in Hong Kong). Meanwhile,
                        importers exaggerated imports in order to remit more money overseas" />
                    As of 2001, total non-performing loans could be as high as 50% of China's GDP.
