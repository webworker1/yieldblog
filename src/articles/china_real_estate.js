                    Three questions have haunted me for years:<br/>
                    I). How "overvalued" is the Chinese real estate market, and why is it overvalued?<br/>
                    II). Given the dozens of stories about Chinese economic dysfunction, when does the "China Bubble" burst, and what will trigger it? <br/>
                    III). What is the "real reason" behind the Belt and Road Initiative, and China's tolerance for vendor-financing to developing nations? Belt and Road is a development strategy where China lends money to developing nations to build infrastructure that promotes trade. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h2> Real Estate: Part I </h2>
                    When we think of "home ownership", we tend to imagine a two-story home in a US midwestern city, occupied by an American nuclear family.  This is is incorrect. China is now the world‚Äôs biggest housing market, with US$1.7 trillion of new home sales last year, seven times the total transactions in the US.  The Chinese home ownership market so dwarfs the US market that the archetype of home ownership should now be a two or three-bedroom apartment in Beijing or Shanghai with two or three generations of family living together, with the home jointly owned by 60 year old grandparents and their 30-year old Chinese millenial children, with second or third investment properties.
                    <br/>Just how unaffordable is real estate for the typical Beijing or Shanghai resident?  It's very easy to point to luxury developments in Manhattan, Beijing, or SF and call the cities unaffordable,
                    but luxury city-center apartments generally represent only a very small percent of the working population of a metro area.  Commuters can always simply live farther away:  for driving cities with plenty of roads, total available metro area increases as a square of distance: for example, we have 1ùúã sq. miles in a one-mile radius, but 9ùúã sq. miles in a 3 mile radius: commute time has tripled but total available living area has increased 9x.
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    The reason I'm explaining fifth-grade math is because it critically informs sampling decisions: in a 10-mile radius, "city center" might represent as little as 4% of total available living area, and is as such unrepresentative of typical residents.  As such the price per square foot and rental values you'll find below all use "outside of city center" values from <Link href="https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/">Numbeo</Link>, rather than city-center values.

                    <b> Some key take-aways </b> <br />
                    1. Beijing and Shanghai have zero property taxes and 3% income taxes for the median homeowner, yet housing affordability still remains by far the worst among surveyed locations:  as a multiple of take-home pay, Beijing and Shanghai are twice as unafforable as <u>San Francisco</u>.
                    <br/>
                    2. On a nominal basis, Beijing and Shanghai apartments cost about as much as Manhattan apartments: about $600k for a halfway-decent 900 sq. ft apartment<br />
                    3. In part due to zero property taxes, Beijing and Shanghai rental yields are incredibly low: ~1% yields versus 2.7% for Manhattan to up to 4.7% for Dallas (note all figures are net of local property taxes and estimated repair costs).  This is hugely concerning:  Chinese government 10-year bonds yield 3.2% so the fact that investors are willing to 1% rental returns suggests that <u>poor investment alternatives are not the only cause:</u> investors are not just yield-starved for new investment opportunities, but in fact continue to speculate aggressively.<br /> <br/>
                    Myths of the Chinese real estate bubble are no exaggeration: home prices (even with lower tax rates) are too high, rental yields are too low, and investors are not even pursuing available investment alternatives like government bonds, which are 3x home rental yields.  While the "optimal" activity for Chinese investors would be to <u>rent</u> an apartment and invest saved money into government bonds, consumers continue to push for home ownership.
                    <br /> Let's try to understand how much of this is caused by Chinese government policies, and how much is cultural. <br/>
                    The NYTimes, reports a cute story suggesting that <Link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/asia/15bachelors.html">the dating market appears to be a contributor</Link> (the Times has really cornered the market on dishy stories told with New England propriety, don't you think?).
                    <QuoteStub quotedText="‚ÄúMy friends tell me I‚Äôm quite handsome,‚Äù he said in confident English one recent evening, fingering his car keys as if they were a talisman. But by the exacting standards of single Chinese women, it seems, Mr. Wang lacks that bankable attribute known as real property. Given that even a cramped, two-bedroom apartment on the dusty fringe of the capital sells for about $150,000, Mr. Wang‚Äôs $900-a-month salary means he may forever be condemned to the ranks of the renting.
                    Last year, he said, this deficiency prompted a high-end dating agency to reject his application. In recent months, half a dozen women have turned down a second meeting after learning that he had no means to buy a home." />

                    <b>Above, Mr. Wang trying to save for a home</b><br/>
                    There definitely seem to be <Link href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2086636/why-rate-home-ownership-so-high-among-chinese">cultural preferences</Link>:
                    <QuoteStub quotedText="‚ÄúProperties are fixed assets, a more material investment than something like stocks,‚Äù Ye said.
                    ‚ÄúOnce middle-class young people save some money, they invest in real estate. There aren‚Äôt that many other industries to choose from for investments or that they have confidence in.‚Äù
                    Parents on the mainland also often provide down payments on their children‚Äôs properties. The survey found that 40 per cent of young homeowners sought help when buying." />
                    This preference seems to even extend to Chinese-American households: in a <Link href="https://lusk.usc.edu/research/working-papers/why-are-chinese-homeownership-rates-so-high"> 2003 whitepaper entitled "Why are Chinese Homeownership Rates so high?" </Link>
                     researchers state that <QuoteStub quotedText="Chinese homeownership rates adjusted by socioeconomic and housing market
                    characteristics are on average 18 percentage points higher than those of native white households." />
                    Chinese Americans unaffected by China's political economy still show an 18% higher home ownership rate while controlling for income and educational attainment: I think this is the best measurable and controlled evidence yet that demonstrates a cultural bias in favor of home ownership.<br/>
                    When I last visited China, I remember a culture very oriented around anecdotes.  Ideas were not "researched" or "analyzed" in the way that this blog might, but instead disseminated through famous anecdotes.  One such story, recently told to me by a friend who'd been back much more recently, went something like this: <br/> <br/>
                    <i>After China decided to reform university staff compensation, existing professors were given a choice: buy the state-sponsored apartments they'd lived in for free at a "market rates", or go out and find their own homes elsewhere.  Fifteen years later, price appreciate from these apartments have been so dramatic that professors
                        who held onto the apartments made more from their apartment than what their non-apartment buying peers made, in total</i>.  Ladies and gentlemen, love is a powerful force, but FOMO is an even more powerful force.  And that story is FOMO AF.<br/> <br/>

                    In actual China, families are massively overweighted toward housing with 74% of total assets in real estate compared to the US at only 35%: <Image widthOverride="300px" href="https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/11/26/266b2d7e-f07e-11e8-b0fe-c62dccd2d711_972x_181123.jpg" />
                    Today, <u>90% of Chinese families own a home, while about one out of four Chinese households own multiple homes</u>, according to research by China‚Äôs Southwestern University.  One would think that, given the incredibly high existing home ownership rate in China and the relatively low immigration and population growth rates, that home prices should and would decline.  But wait: Chinese have basically no outlets for their accumulated capital outside of real estate: an individual may only exchange up to $50,000 USD worth of RMB annually and corporate governance in China is the least shareholder-friendly structure I've ever seen:  2/3 of companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange are state enterprises without independent boards. 

                    From all of this data, we can conclude a few things: <br/>
                    1. <u>The housing market is definitely in speculative territory:</u> home ownership rates are already exceptionally high, while rental yields are as low as 1-1.5%, so most property being purchased is speculative.
                    2. Alternative investments for Chinese investors are very poor, 

                    <br/><b> Total nonsequitur: </b> <br />
                    If you're a particularly eagle-eyed reader, you'll notice Dallas home prices-to-take-home pay is <u>incredibly low</u>: $200,000 for a 900-sq foot home looks like a steal, and to add on top of that zero state taxes and my initial reaction to this was to start looking for a job in Dallas (just kidding: Dallas sucks).  Here's the issue:  Dallas property taxes are insanely high: at 3.6%, owning a $100,000 home would be like having a $100,000 loan that charges you $300 a month in taxes.  Property values appear to be depressed as a result:  Dallas collects only 10% more tax revenue per property than Brooklyn despite having 4x higher property tax rates.
                    For a long time, I thought the Reagan-era <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer Curve</Link> was just a neoconservative talking point: "lowering taxes may increase tax revenue" seems fanciful, but perhaps property taxes are the perfect example! Stated a different way:  when we tax the full value of an asset, rather than its net income stream, the value of that asset should decline proportionally (as if it were generating lower cash flow). In a really extreme scenario (20% property taxes), homes would be primarily liability-machines whose "rent" was mostly composed of an assessed tax obligation, and that home might well be worth nearly zero.
