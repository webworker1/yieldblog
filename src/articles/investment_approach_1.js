            I don't have a lot to add on the quantitative approaches -- there are many good books you can read. So before you apply any concepts outlined below, I'd strongly encourage that you first have a solid understanding of: <br/> */}
            <br/>a). The relative opportunity costs of T-Bills, corporate debt, and equities. This means having a good "feel" for the relative earnings yields of equities, relative bond yields, and knowing
            where the current yield curve is set.  This is by far the most important factor to investing, and fucking this up will lose you lots of money, and getting this right is more important to making money
            than any Fancy Play Syndrome advice that's coming up.  You have to have a good sense for where the line is drawn between a good deal, a decent deal, and a bad deal, across market conditions<br/>
            

            <br/>b). Comfort reading a 10-K.  If you're uncomfortable, just start reading a few dozen front-to-back and you'll get the hang of it. <br/>
            <br/>c). An understanding of a company's future sources and uses of funding (debt, working capital needs, unfunded liabilities). <br/>
            <br/> With that out of the way, I want to talk about what I would consider secondary or tertiary factors to a company that may help tip the balance of your investing decision-making.
