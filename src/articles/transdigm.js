                    Look, I'm as worried as you are about the next recession. Personally, I don't want to overpay for stocks, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/berkshire-shareholder-sells-stake-accusing-buffett-of-thumb-sucking.html" target="_blank">some colleagues in my profession seem to agree</a>.
                    So why not own some bonds? With S&P P/E ratios hovering at 23x as of November 2019, bond-holders only need to earn a 4.3% return to beat the "opportunity cost" of the stock market (ex-growth), while taking less risk. Transdigm is a reasonable tradeoff here, offering a 4.9% yield-to-worst trading at 103, but substantially better (~6%) in a best-case scenario of maturity.
                    Mostly, I want to own bonds that have slightly higher risk than US government bonds, while getting paid a lot more yield. Being able to get ~6% at maturity is a pretty incredible, given that in market downturns, Transdigm bonds will likely not trade at a significant discount to par, owing to their near-term maturity and incredibly stable, sticky business. How stable?  How sticky?
                    <br/> <br/> Sticky-icky sticky.<br/>
                    <b>80% of revenue is sole-sourced widgets to the US government, sold at an insane mark-up</b>

                    <br/><br/>
                    And super stable too. <br/>
                    <b>75% of EBITDA is from stable after-market, so a pause in new equipment acquisition by the government won't cut revenues in half in a downturn</b>

                    Transdigm is infamous for providing specific after-market parts at incredibly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-12/defense-abuses-like-9-400-markup-on-parts-targeted-in-new-bill" target="_blank"> high markups </a> and a <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/06/06/lawmakers-order-deeper-transdigm-probe-by-dod-watchdog/" target="_blank"> lot </a> of <a href="https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2019/05/16/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-puts-cleveland-based-transdigms-government-contract-profit-margins-in-spotlight-again" target="_blank"> lawmakers </a> are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/28/ro-khanna-transdigm-refund-pentagon/" target="_blank"> pissed </a>.

                    <br/>
                    The Transdigm gameplan is very simple: acquire more companies, and combine those companies' expertise with their expertise in selling under government contracts.  Transdigm acquires 2-3 companies a year, jacks up prices on those companies' products, and sells them to Uncle Sam.
                    <br/>
                    <b>This produces astronomically high operating margins and growing income</b>
                    <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/jjbjPsn.png" />
                    <b> And allows Transdigm to lever up and take more balance sheet risk </b>
                    <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/LbN22UG.png" />
                    Think about it this way:  even if bureaucrats are pissed, are they really going to work super hard and compare all those super complicated widgets, and try to find equivalent super-complicated widgets?  The worst-case scenario for Transdigm is a significant cut to some of the prices of some of the products, especially as it continues to grow its portfolio of available products through acquisition.  The win-win for everybody is for Congresspeople to embarass Transdigm, get a small refund, and declare victory, while Transdigm continues to rip off the US government.
                    Why not own your special little piece of that ripoff?<br/>That's why I think Transdigm bonds, yielding ~6%, are substantially better deal than Transdigm shares (yielding ~2.5% at a 40x P/E), and the shares will also be first-impaired in the event of a downturn.
                    I'm not saying you should buy Transdigm bonds, <u> because this definitely isn't financial advice and you are on your own and I bear no responsibility for your losses</u>, but I personally own a shitload of Transdigm bonds, specifically TRANSDIGM INC NOTE CALL MAKE WHOLE 6.50000% 05/15/2025 (893647AZ0).  As in, larger than the downpayment on my home.  I might not in the future, but as of 11/10/2019, I am basically having Transdigm's baby.
