                    Look, I'm as worried as you are about the next recession. Personally, I don't want to overpay for stocks, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/berkshire-shareholder-sells-stake-accusing-buffett-of-thumb-sucking.html" target="_blank">some colleagues in my profession seem to agree</a>.
                    So why not own some bonds? With S&P P/E ratios hovering at 23x as of November 2019, bond-holders only need to earn a 4.3% return to beat the "opportunity cost" of the stock market (ex-growth), while taking less risk. Transdigm is a reasonable tradeoff here, offering a 4.9% yield-to-worst trading at 103, but substantially better (~6%) in a best-case scenario of maturity.
                    Being able to get ~6% at maturity is a pretty incredible, given that in market downturns, Transdigm bonds will likely not trade at a significant discount to par, owing to their near-term maturity and incredibly stable, sticky business. <br/>
                    Transdigm is infamous for providing specific after-market parts at incredibly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-12/defense-abuses-like-9-400-markup-on-parts-targeted-in-new-bill" target="_blank"> high markups </a> and a <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/06/06/lawmakers-order-deeper-transdigm-probe-by-dod-watchdog/" target="_blank"> lot </a> of <a href="https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2019/05/16/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-puts-cleveland-based-transdigms-government-contract-profit-margins-in-spotlight-again" target="_blank"> lawmakers </a> are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/28/ro-khanna-transdigm-refund-pentagon/" target="_blank"> pissed </a>.
                    As a bond-holder, we are primarily concerned with the worst-case scenario:  the US government intervenes as Transdigm's largest buyer and decides to unilaterally cut rates.
                    However, this seems incredibly unlikely to me. <b>80% of revenue is sole-sourced</b> and, is the U.S. government really going to have bureaucrats going through a catalog of thousands of Transdigm widgets, and determine whether or not that widget is replaceable by some other widget from some other company?  Can you imagine having some bureaucrat determine if a highly specialized, highly-engineered part is replaceable?
                    <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/qYNwKO7.png" />

                    Think about it this way:  even if bureaucrats are pissed, are they really going to work super hard for months or years, and compare all those super complicated widgets, and try to find equivalent super-complicated widgets?  What's the political upside to that, especially if one bad part causes a fatal plane crash?  The worst-case scenario for Transdigm is a significant cut to some of the prices of some of the products, especially as it continues to grow its portfolio of available products through acquisition.  The win-win for everybody is for Senators and Representatives to embarass Transdigm, get a small refund, and declare victory, while Transdigm continues to rip off the US government.
                    Why not own your special little piece of that ripoff?<br/>That's why I think Transdigm bonds, yielding ~6%, are substantially better deal than Transdigm shares (yielding ~2.5% at a 40x P/E), and the shares will also be first-impaired in the event of a downturn.

                    And super stable too. <br/>
                    <b>75% of EBITDA is from stable after-market, so a pause in new equipment acquisition by the government won't cut revenues in half in a downturn</b>

                    <br/>
                    The Transdigm gameplan is very simple: acquire more companies, and combine those companies' expertise with their expertise in selling under government contracts.  Transdigm acquires 2-3 companies a year, jacks up prices on those companies' products, and sells them to Uncle Sam.

                    I'm not saying you should buy Transdigm bonds, <u> because this definitely isn't financial advice and you are on your own and I bear no responsibility for your losses</u>, but I personally own a shitload of Transdigm bonds, specifically TRANSDIGM INC NOTE CALL MAKE WHOLE 6.50000% 05/15/2025 (893647AZ0).  As in, larger than the downpayment on my home.  I might not in the future, but as of 11/10/2019, I am basically having Transdigm's baby.
