                    The best investment you can make today is how you spend your time and the best way you can spend your time is:<br/><b>1).</b> Exercising.<br/><b>2).</b> Learning to code.<br/>I'm here to sell you on #2: coding in 2019 is much, much easier than it was 20 years ago. There are literally millions of pages online to help you when you get stuck,
                    so patience plus Google will get you out of confusing situations.  This is not to say that starting to learn is easy -- it's not, and you <u>will</u> get stuck and have frustrating days -- but it's infinitely easier than it was 20 years ago. The world is now bifurcated between software <u>users</u> and software <u>creators</u>: almost every company is spending billions on engineers to modernize their existing assets through better distribution through web and mobile applications.  Companies like Amazon and Salesforce were early to the game, but now even companies like Disney are fully invested.
                      Tech is no longer tech:  tech is everything, and you need to know how to code, or you will probably lose your job to some Gen Z kid who grew up with Python.  <b>Do marketing or finance?</b>  Learn Python, and gain a massive edge over your peers when dealing with large datasets.  <b>Want to change careers?</b>  Learn Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, move to New York or another high-demand tech hub, and get a job at a startup.
                    <b>  Experienced software engineer like me?</b>  I'm taking the Coursera Kubernetes and deep learning courses.  Want to create your own video games?  They've got you covered. Look it's really simple:  just take all the time you spend on Reddit, add it with all the time you spend hate-watching your least favorite Netflix shows, and use that time on something way better.  Do it now.  Change your life.
