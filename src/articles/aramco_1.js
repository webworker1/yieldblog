                    Everyone should be excited to read the <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/-/media/images/investors/saudi-aramco-prospectus-en.pdf?la=en&hash=8DE2DCD689D6E383BB8F4C393033D8964C9F5585" target="_blank">prospectus</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/world/middleeast/saudi-royal-family-money.html">world's biggest sugar daddy</a>, financing the dolce vitas of 15,000 Junior Associate Deputy Crown Princes.
                    Describing Saudi Aramco as the "crown jewel" of Saudi Arabia (as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/dealbook/aramco-ipo.html"> <u>every</u> </a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50365604"> <u>damn</u> </a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191110-tech-juggernaut-saudi-aramco-faces-new-test-shareholders"> <u>publication</u> </a> does) sells the company short.
                    Aramco is more of a crown jewel factory, making up nearly 40% of Saudi Arabia's GDP, and generating $111bn in earnings every year, producing roughly one crown jewel daily. <br/>
                    <hr />
                    <b> Fact #1: The government of Saudi Arabia owns 100% of Saudi Aramco </b>
                    <img style={{width: "540px"}} src="https://i.imgur.com/1IrdMFJ.png"></img>
                    Honestly, I expected a laundry list cap table of 15,000 Saudi Prince fuccbois each owning a small percentage. Aramco seems to have taken extra pain to demonstrate that its shareholder list was clean, consolidated, and fuccboi-free, explicitly stating that the Public owns "--" and the Company Treasury owns "--".
                    <hr />
                    <b> Fact #2: The government is issuing itself a dividend </b> <br/>
                    <i> "On 1 November 2019G, the Company declared an ordinary dividend of $13.4 billion with respect to the fiscal
                    quarter ended 30 September 2019G. In addition, the Company will declare an interim (ordinary) dividend of a
                    maximum of $9.5 billion... These dividends will be paid to the
                    Government (in its capacity as the sole shareholder in the Company) and investors in the Offer Shares will not be
                    entitled to any portion of these dividends regardless of when they are paid...""
                    </i>
                    <hr />
                    This makes sense: Saudi government effectively uses Aramco as its personal money-hose, plowing Aramco earnings into its sovereign wealth fund.
                    <hr />
                    <b> Fact #3: The IPO is slated to represent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/saudi-aramco-unveils-ipo-prospectus-will-sell-up-to-05-of-shares-to-individual-investors-2019-11-10"> only 0.5% of the total shares</a>, or about $7.5bn </b> 
                    <hr />
                    So the government which owns Saudi Aramco outright, is issuing itself $20bn+ in dividends while looking to raise $8-$20bn.
                    <img style={{width: "540px"}} src="https://media.giphy.com/media/4NnSe87mg3h25JYIDh/giphy.gif"></img>
                    This doesn't quite make sense: Aramco makes $9 billion USD every month: why go through the scrutiny of public filing for raising only $8bn?
                    <b> It seems like something didn't go as planned: </b> Aramco IPO represents a "pre-broken" IPO that the Saudis are trying to salvage:  by restricting the offering to a tiny 0.5% sliver of total shares, Aramco ensures that the shares will be owned by
                    only shareholders that value the company at the higher end of the range. Things have gotten so bad that Aramco is now offering an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6ffab68-016e-11ea-be59-e49b2a136b8d" target="_blank">ownership bonus</a>: one share for every ten shares held for longer than six months. <br/> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BdgYM2p.jpg" style={{width: "540px"}} />
                    <br/> There is a natural spectrum of valuations for Saudi Aramco, from about $2 trillion USD to as low as perhaps $1 trillion USD.  The top 0.5% of bullish investors
                    might value Aramco at $2 trillion, while the next 1% might value Aramco at $1.9 trillion, etc. etc. <br/>
                    If Aramco floats only 0.5% of their shares, those shares will be traded and held among a group of investors that by definition will value Aramco more highly than the next 0.5% of investors who would otherwise own Aramco.
                    Aramco's tiny float strongly suggests they've chosen to IPO in the most nominal, face-saving way possible:  sell a tiny sliver of themselves to their biggest fans.
                    <br/>
                    <hr />
                    <b> Fact #4: Saudi Government and by extension Aramco owns all Saudi hydrocarbon rights </b> <br/>
                    <i>
                    "All hydrocarbons in the Kingdom are owned by the Kingdom and, upon extraction or recovery of such
                    hydrocarbons by the Company, title to such hydrocarbons automatically passes to the Company at the ownership
                    transfer point."
                    </i> <br/>
                    <hr />
                    I wonder if this clause is the real reason for all the drama behind the IPO. The Saudi family wants to sell pieces of Aramco in order to diversify, and believes its company deserves to trade at a premium to existing oil majors like Exxon-Mobile (trading at 20x trailing earnings). Here's the conversation I imagine keeps happening, leading up to the IPO: <br/>
                    <b>Saudis</b>: "Wall Street investors, you should buy a piece of us privately and value us at $2 trillion. After all, our company has a freeroll on all new oil wells in Saudi Arabia, we have $0 of net debt, and we have some of the lowest cash-costs of production in the world.  You should value us <i> at least </i> at the same multiple as an inferior company like Exxon-Mobile, which would put us in in the $2 trillion range". <br/>
                    <b>Wall Street</b>: "Nah. Something something Jamal Khashoggi something something rule of law." <br/>
                    <b>Saudis</b>: "I'll show you!" *shakes fist and goes on an IPO roadshow* <br/>
                    <b>Saudis</b>: "Mr. Public Wall Street investors, please pay us more money". <br/>
                    <b>Mr. Public Wall Street</b>: "We're actually basically the same people, so... nah"<br/>
                    <b>Saudis</b>: "Guys? Guys?"<br/>

                    <QuoteStub quotedTitle="Fact #5: Saudi Arabia will deplete its current reserves in 67-69 years." quotedText="As at 31 December 2018G, the Kingdomâ€™s reserves in the fields the Company operates consisted of 336.2 billion
                    barrels of oil equivalent, including 261.5 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate, 36.1 billion barrels of NGLs
                    and 233.8 trillion standard cubic feet of natural gas." />
                    Given its current production rate of 10.3 million barrels of crude oil a day, current reserves will be depleted in less than 70 years. This global liquidation of a nation represents the most aggressive form of late-stage capitalism: 15,000 men control the wealth and means of production of a country whose citizens only have skills that serve the needs of those 15,000 men; its political interests are inseparable from the interests of its wealthy; and that wealth is fully liquid and globally transferable.
                    I would not be surprised if in 200 years, having fully depleted the wealth of its nation, the Saudi Royal family completely abandons its own country to live on dividend streams in Switzerland and Palm Springs.<br/>
