                    Working on Wall Street is not that different from other highly-competitive jobs with nebulous deliverables.
                    In fashion, publishing, and media, thousands of people compete to differentiate themselves however they can,
                    <a href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-05/19/11/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/original-grid-image-15541-1495206536-1.jpg?crop=683:1025;0,0&downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto" target="_blank"> even when it's a bad idea</a>.
                    <br /> Finance is remarkably similar: professionals are desperate to prove that they are creating value by doing something differentiated. 
                    As such, there seems to be a heavy bias among active investors to own companies that
                    kind of suck, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-ackman-valeant-slide-deck-2015-10#-12" target="_blank">but are doing something</a>.
                    Bill Ackman infamously lost $4bn on Valeant, a company which did minimal R&D but hiked up prices after acquiring drug companies.
                    Valeant represented the perfect hedge fund hotel that exploited the investing biases of an industry: <br /> 1. It was easy to model:  analysts could credibly justify
                    to their bosses that earnings would go up, because Valeant had a history of jacking up prices. <br/> 2. Management
                    sounded investor-friendly: Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson knows that investors have a fire under their ass to produce returns,
                    and cannot stomach the multi-decade journey that true value creation takes.
                    <br/> I remember at one point walking into the office of my portfolio manager and trying to convince him that Amazon was a great idea (this was in late 2013 when Amazon traded around $300/share).
                    He looked at me and asked, indignantly: "But what edge do we have?" I stood, dumbstruck.  I had no edge, we both knew that Amazon was the future, but felt we had to be clever, differentiated, and analytical, rather than ride the Bezos gravy train. <br/>This is the critical flaw to all hedge fund investing:
                    investors look for informational edges, but rarely do they look for business-quality or judgment edges.  These type of assessments tend to be eschewed in professional investing circles:
                    it's way too hard to argue that, for example, Union Pacific Railroad is substantially better at delivering long-term shareholder value than Activision-Blizzard. <br/>
                    So what does the hedge fund industry do?  We look for interesting "hard catalysts" and "hard signals": turnarounds, channel-checks, industry shifts, rather than look for the quietest companies that are doing their hardest to not
                    gain the attention of regulators. The flaw to this approach is that managers of shitty companies in challenged industries will always try to look busiest and most effective, and managers
                    of collusive oligopolies will never, ever reveal how powerful their market advantage is, for fear of regulators.
                     Many books, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Capitalism-Monopolies-Death-Competition/dp/1119548195/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=myth+of+capitalism&qid=1572199055&sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Myth of Capitalism </a> 
                     to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One </a> already discuss this extensively. <br />
                    So we have a bunch of investment professionals that are trying to look busy, and a bunch of CEOs of shitty companies that are also trying to look busy.
                    Meanwhile, oligopolies and monopolies in areas like waste management, railroads, and semiconductor equipment stay as far off the radar as possible.
                    Analysts can't justify to their bosses that revenues will get better every year, because the CEOs and investor relations folks will never
                    reveal just how much market power they actually have. <a href="https://www.ccn.com/while-dow-surges-hedge-funds-underperform-by-ridiculous-margin/" target="_blank"> It's no wonder hedge funds continue to underperform </a>
                    they are literally picking the noisiest, most vocal companies and ignoring quiet winners.
                    <br /> Your advantage is very simple: for your personal investments, you have no boss.  You don't have to prove you're doing your job,
                    and you are free to pick the quiet, silent monopolists.
